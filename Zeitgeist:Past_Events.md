**21st-24th February 2023: CUSP London Data Dive - Mental Health Analytics - King's College London** <br>
This was an amazing live hybrid event across 4 time zones - Australia, Singapore, USA and UK with 70 UG & PG students in 11 groups guided by 8 expert mentors.<br>

**Scenario and Data Sources:** A Visual Analytics exploration of Mental health Data Correlations.<br>
Teams & Mentors from KCL, UCL, Glasgow, NYU and Curtin University.<br>
**We were joined by several of our external partners:
AccuCities 3D City Models, NHS NE London ICB, Ansell & Bailey Architects, Helix Data Innovation and WSP.**

<blockquote>One of the highlights for me was witnessing first-hand how participants were able to transfer their data science skills into a detailed and compelling presentation on urban mental health within just three days. The content was informative and engaging........I would highly recommend this event to anyone interested in data science and seeing how it can be applied to real-world challenges.<br>

**26th October 2022: CUSP London PhD Conference  12:30-17:30 King's College London - Bush House** <br>

This was a wonderful event which included 11 speakers from 5 universities: King's, Newcastle, Warwick, Glasgow, Edinburgh and LSHTM. The presenters were at different stages of their studies, and as such could provide identification, guidance, ideas and networking as well as pertinent questioning of the work presented.
We will be hosting a PhD Conference again around the same time next year, please do let us know if you are interested in presenting! 

<blockquote> A really useful and enjoyable conference! This was my first time at CUSP. It was a great chance to network with PhD students from across the country and meet professional people in visualization. Thanks for organizing! I look forward to next year<br>
