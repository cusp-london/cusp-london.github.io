This is a wonderful opportunity to see if a PhD is something you would like to embark on and find out the best way to do this.<br>
* We have PhDs from 6 universities: Kingâ€™s, Warwick, UCL, Newcastle, Glasgow and LSHTM presenting their work for 10 minutes each plus Q&A<br>
* Each PhD is at a different stage of their studies, so it will be a great insight into what each part of the process involves.<br>
* We will have refreshments and networking opportunities <br>
* All the presentations are varied to ensure an excellent overview.<br>

**If you would like to attend, please email me at CUSP-London@kcl.ac.uk by 18th October 2022.
