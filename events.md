#### Data Dive 2021 Future Mobility

The week-long Data Dive (or "Hackathon") is CUSP London's flagship annual event and has been since 2015. This year in 2021, we ran a timely theme on Future Mobility from 15th March to 19th March, in support of partners such as, but not limited to, Transport for London (TfL), WSP UK, GHD Group, Westminster City Council, Ginger, Chordant Inc., RunFriendly, ActiveThings and Reed Mobility. Detailed coverage from [King's College London news](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/looking-towards-the-future-of-urban-mobility).

The 9 divers' teams are comprised of postgraduate students and alumni from CUSP London at King's College London, CASA at UCL, University of Warwick and CUSP at New York University; working intensively on topics relating to future urban mobility such as: the potential of micro-mobility to transform urban mobility in UK cities; how it changes over time among different UK cities and towns, the Covid-19 impacts on rail demand across London as well as the possible behavioural change evolvement in the future. Considerations such as whether it might be more or less active for future commuter travel? The driving behaviour changes in London pre- and post- Covid were looked at along with and the optimal ways to improve air quality in London through transport changes, and to explore the cycling-relevant street infrastructure changes for future support. Comparatively, the driving/commuter behaviour changes in New York city from the past to post-Covid were studied, and what transport-related initiatives these international cities could exchange to make themselves better ready for the future of urban mobility.
