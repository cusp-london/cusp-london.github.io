# Events

**CUSP London hosts regular events**, ranging from the CUSP London Seminar Series, PhD conferences, Data Dives, Insights and research group events to social CUSP Coffee Catchups, where our academics, students, partners and associates can drop in and meet up with each other (this is currently held online).  Please do [contact us](mailto:cusp-london@kcl.ac.uk) to join the CUSP London Interest mailing list for updates of all events.


**CUSP London Director's strong commitment to the London First Data for London working group has led to the London Data Charter being signed up by King's College London.**
The Charter will underpin a new governance model to be announced by City Hall later this year with signatories becoming part of the ecosystem. Projects already underway include helping meet London’s net zero goals using data to optimise the location of Electric Vehicle infrastructure and identifying areas of digital exclusion to target resources and help. <br>
King's has just signed up to the London Data Charter which encourages sharing of data between organisations for the benefit of Londoners.<br> 
* Arup, Bloomberg, Microsoft, Oliver Wyman Foundation and UK Power Networks have already made their commitment ahead of the launch in September at London Tech Week. Theo Blackwell, London’s Chief Digital Officer has also endorsed it:  
    
<blockquote>“The London Data Charter is a critical part of the infrastructure needed to realise the Mayor’s ambition of unlocking data to meet the capital’s biggest challenges. Signatories to the Charter create a community of data experts and data owners who London’s government will consult and work with on new data collaborations that benefit London and Londoners.”</blockquote>

**The 2021 CUSP London PhD Conference was a huge success!**<br>

![Teddy.jpg]({% link images/Teddy.jpg %})

We had PhD's present their work from King's College London, University of Warwick, University College London, The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Imperial College London.  It was wonderful to have the opportunity to meet face to face again - Plus the networking opportunities with PhD peers and our CUSP London academics were amazingly successful.  Thank you all for helping make it such an engaging event. 

# **CUSP London Showcase 2019-2020-2021**<br>
The Showcase was a wonderful event which enabled CUSP London Students to present their dissertation work to our Academics, Partners and Associates.  There was much interest in the subjects and we have some exciting work ahead leading to real impact in London!<br>
