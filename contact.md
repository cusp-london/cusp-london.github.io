**FAQs:**

* How do I apply for a Master's in Urban Informatics?  [Apply here](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/urban-informatics-msc)
* Do I need to have studied Urban Informatics before taking the Master's? - It is recommended that applicants have an Upper Second Class degree in Computer Science (or related disciplines). An Upper Second in a quantitative subject containing a substantial statistical component will be also be considered, or Geography where this includes a geocomputation component. However, we do consider candidates without the above, but with relevant work experience in large scale data analysis for 2 years or more.
* Will there be an interview on application? - Candidates are interviewed if they do not have the above qualifications, to assess their level of competency.
* How can I get involved in CUSP London Events? - please [contact us](mailto:cusp-london@kcl.ac.uk) and we will see if we can link you up with anyone with a similar specialism or research area.  We will also add you to any event list that you may be interested in.
* Please do contact us if you have any queries at all and we would be happy to assist.
