How do we know the origins and accuracy of information?<br>

**2022 research:** <br>

Inherently multidisciplinary research has led CUSP London to become involved in a diverse range of projects during the last few years. 
Not surprisingly a number of these projects related to COVID-19 and its impact around the world, as academics from all disciplines worked to contribute to understanding and resisting  the pandemic.

Looking to the future there is a pressing need for cognitive technologies that work with people to help find ways to address the most difficult challenges we have faced in many people’s lifetimes.
