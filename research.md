<b>CUSP London Impact Stories:</b>
<b></b>Pioneering Data Driven Humanitarian Aid</B> - Student Placement with The British Red Cross.<br>
Overview:<br>
Ruonan Zhang, an MSc student from King’s College London, interned with the Strategic Insight & Foresight team at the British Red Cross (BRC). Under Michael Page’s guidance, she contributed to the development of the Resilience Index, a tool to identify UK local authorities vulnerable in crises.<br>
Key Contributions:<br>
Data Integration and Workflow Design:<br>
Utilised skills from the MSc Urban Informatics programme to source, process, and integrate data from diverse repositories across four nations.<br>
Employed R programming to structure and simplify data for actionable insights.<br>
Designed a user-friendly and comprehensive workflow for the Resilience Index.<br>
Enhancing Resilience Planning:<br>
Developed a tool combining multiple indicators to pinpoint vulnerable regions.<br>
Ensured data-driven decisions were complemented by community engagement to align aid with real needs.<br>
<b>Impact:</b><br>
Improved the BRC’s resource allocation and preparedness strategies.<br>
Enabled timely, targeted humanitarian interventions with optimized response times.<br>
Personal and Professional Growth:<br>
Gained practical experience in large-scale project management and real-world application of data science.<br>
Enhanced technical skills, including coding and data analysis, while refining her understanding of humanitarian operations.
Left a lasting impact on the BRC’s resilience strategy and fortified her readiness for future roles, including her current position as a Data Scientist at Lynchpin.<br>
Legacy:<br>
Ruonan’s work demonstrates how academic training can drive meaningful humanitarian outcomes, exemplifying KCL’s ethos of transforming knowledge into action.<br>

**2022 research:** <br>

Inherently multidisciplinary research has led CUSP London to become involved in a diverse range of projects during the last few years. 
Not surprisingly a number of these projects related to COVID-19 and its impact around the world, as academics from all disciplines worked to contribute to understanding and resisting  the pandemic.

Looking to the future there is a pressing need for cognitive technologies that work with people to help find ways to address the most difficult challenges we have faced in many people’s lifetimes.
