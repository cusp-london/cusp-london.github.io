> "The MSc Urban Informatics at CUSP London has helped me launch my career in the UK. The course covered advanced Data Science tools and techniques but just as quickly provided real opportunities to use them, working with real-world data in Projects and research... 
A CUSP placement at global consulting firm WSP provided me the connections which gave me my first full-time work in London"
