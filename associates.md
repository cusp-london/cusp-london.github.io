I was born and raised in Naples (Italy), where I also got my Master’s degree in Architecture (2010) and PhD in Environmental Design (2014) . During my PhD I became more and more interested in the relationships between people and everyday sounds, which prompted me to pursue an academic career in the field of environmental acoustics. In 2013, I joined the Acoustics Group of the School of Architecture at the University of Sheffield as a Research Associate to work on the development of soundscape methods within the EU-funded network “SONORUS”. In 2018 I joined UCL IEDE as Research Associate to work with Prof Jian Kang on the Soundscape Indices project, funded by the ERC Advanced Grant scheme.

Specialism: Creative Technology and Data Visual Engineering <br>
Additional work can be found <a href="https://portfolio.izac.us/">here</a>. <br>
I’m a freelance creative technologist and data visualization engineer working with data and tech to design and build platforms and interfaces that solve data-centric business problems and create affective, critical, experiences from physical/digital artifacts. My area of expertise lies in data visualization, information design, and creative uses of data. This involves implementing data-rich UIs that condense and allow for exploration of multi-dimensional datasets. Sometimes it entails developing POCs using emerging technologies and advising on the creative possibilities of tech for communications work. Through this context, I work within multi-disciplinary teams in different stages of product development—from ideation and prototyping to production. 

My work has been awarded (D&AD, Eurobest, Campaign UK etc) and shortlisted (Cannes) for its creative applications of data and storytelling.

<a href="mailto:jk726@cam.ac.uk">Email</a><br>
Dr Joanna Kusiak is a Research Fellow in Urban Studies at King’s College, Cambridge. Her work focuses on urban land, property and the role that legal technicalities play in shaping our cities. At CUSP, she hopes to bring perspectives from critical urban studies together with technological innovations in order to experiment with new models of ownership for tackling the housing crisis. A key question for her research is to which extent we can use the data sets and technologies associated with ‘platform capitalism’ to design an efficient and democratic system for allocating socially owned housing? While her research is not confined to any region, Joanna is especially committed – as an activist and as an architecture/urban critic – to the cities of Warsaw and Berlin. In 2019 the International Journal of Urban and Regional Research awarded her essay ‘Legal Technologies of Primitive Accumulation: Judicial Robbery and Dispossession‐by‐Restitution in Warsaw‘ Best Article Prize ‘for the article that makes the most original and outstanding contribution to our understanding of cities and urbanization.’ She tweets at @jkkusiak.

Jali is currently studying for an MSc in Behaviour Change at University College London. He is interested in how we can understand residents’ perceptions of their neighbourhoods and how these perceptions relate to broader psychological phenomena. His current research explores how we can increase engagement from marginalised communities in urban regeneration projects, to ensure that urban development is an inclusive and sustainable process.  

His undergraduate thesis, conducted in collaboration with Nokia Bell Labs and the Cambridge Personality & Social Dynamics Research Group, applied Big Data approaches to understanding human behaviour and personality. This paper investigated the relationship between personality and urban ambiance of neighborhoods in New York City, analysing a large-scale personality dataset and inferring urban ambiance from geo-referenced Flickr photos using computerized text analysis. He recently presented this research at the Society for Personality & Social Psychology annual convention in New Orleans:
