# Director's Message 2025

As always, everyone at CUSP London collaborated to maintain and extend our vibrant pipeline of multidisciplinary research. Our main priority continues to be producing tangible results that have a real-world impact on our academic associates and partners. From one-hour seminars to multi-million-pound funding bids, it has been inspiring to see how CUSP London melds our thinking across the College to address todayâ€™s critical urban and extra-urban challenges.

The year of 2024 was a great success for all in CUSP London, and we are looking forward to more extended and consolidated collaborations into 2025 in diverse formats, including but not limited with more events, connect to more partners, publish more academic papers, and more research projects bids.
