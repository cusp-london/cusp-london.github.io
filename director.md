# Director's Message 2023

As always, everyone at CUSP London collaborated to maintain and extend our vibrant pipeline of multidisciplinary research. Our main priority continues to be producing tangible results that have a real-world impact on our academic associates and partners. From one-hour seminars to multi-million-pound funding bids, it has been inspiring to see how CUSP London melds our thinking across the College to address todayâ€™s critical urban and extra-urban challenges.

This year was a great success for all in CUSP London; we hosted more events, connected to more partners, published more academic papers, and submitted and supported more research projects, winning the majority of those bids. It was a hugely positive outcome all around.
