# About Us

The **Centre for Urban Science and Progress London (CUSP London)** is a joint initiative of [King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/research/cusp-london) and the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/northamerica/cusp/warwick/). Its aim is to bring together researchers, businesses, local authorities and government agencies to apply urban science to improving citizen’s lives, including their health and wellbeing. The creation of CUSP London follows the highly successful establishment of the Centre for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) in New York, and it is intended that the two 
units will work closely together.

**What We Do**

CUSP London’s expertise spans Computer Science, Computational Social Science and Health & Medicine.  Areas of particular interest include:

* Agent-based modelling of individuals, organisations, and their environment in a range of applied urban contexts (e.g. travel mode choice, neighbourhood change).
* AI-based reasoning in support of policy-development in urban applications such as hazards and resilience, security and conflict, and planning and regeneration (e.g. counter-terrorism, autonomous vehicles, and history-based personalisation for service users).
* Sensor network deployment and citizen science in challenging urban environments, including post-disaster and ‘low-tech’ contexts (e.g. air quality/pollution, resilient networks).
* Text-mining in support of healthcare data collection and analytics in urban areas (e.g. mental health, active travel).

These activities are underpinned by a commitment to transparency and openness with respect to how we develop and document analytical pipelines and results from end-to-end.

In its activities, CUSP London ensures the following:

* Conduct fundamental and applied world leading research, in collaboration with its partners across its agreed technical scope
* Promote the highest level of skill and expertise in urban science
* Be multidisciplinary, transcending traditional discipline boundaries
* Offer masters-level courses both separately and potentially as an integrated part of a PhD programme
* Deliver research to the public through open access papers, open source code, and open data sets
* Enter into agreements with business, government, public and third-sector organisations to facilitate research
* Always act ethically and responsibly to benefit the common good
* Deliver research that is aligned with industry and commerce
